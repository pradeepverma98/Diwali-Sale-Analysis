Diwali Sales Analysis Project
This project aims to Analyze Diwali sales data to uncover key customer purchasing trends and demographics. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I performed data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to derive actionable insights. The analysis identifies patterns in customer behavior across various segments like gender, age group, state, occupation, and product categories.
